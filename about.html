Im originally from Yucatan, Mexico, where theres a strong sense of folklore, and that has embedded itself in everything I do. My passion for storytelling is what drives me and the creative decisions I make. Creating art has also provided a way for me to express myself emotionally. Even in the darkest moments, the process of creating art has been the solution to understanding things better. This project, Epilogue, allowed me to digest what precisely the after-life is and why its so mysterious. By writing and presenting it as a story, I want to transmit what I learned and felt to the viewer. The story in this project is not autobiographical; it belongs to this character. Rather than presenting a personal outlook on the past, I chose to have it appear like its characters story. The work is a reflection of this characters history and how it connects to his legacy. I wanted to depict a story with a unique setting. Large elaborate sets seemed unattainable, but a little creativity could go a long way. Each scene was comprised of different elements to create a single composition using miniature sculpture, matte painting, and digital compositing. Theres one sole reason I chose to use this method: to create the illusion of scale. By photographing miniatures and making the character appear small, I make the viewer feel larger and god-like. The viewer can observe the character transition over time behind a window. Though were presently watching, the character does not know of our existence. The characters development is motivated by the guidance put into his life; in turn, we learn something ourselves. I specifically chose twelve photographs to symbolize the twelve numbers on a clock. We move forward eternally until we end up right where we started. Death is a terrifying subject matter because we dont know when it comes, yet its the one sure thing in life. The experience of a friend passing away made me realize no one is immortal. I believe we have a limited time on this earth in order to give life value.<br>I want viewers to ask themselves a question: if you could change your past, how would it change you? That distinct question will only be answered by our actions. Every day we fill one more page in our book. There are rarely second chances, and we only have one life. Its difficult to discern whether there is another world after death. However, we do know theres a legacy that continues to live for us. We are each the hero of our epic tale; how can we make our story last beyond a lifetime?
